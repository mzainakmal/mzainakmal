Mathematics graduate from Institut Teknologi Bandung | Data Enthusiast | Experienced in Data Modelling, AI, and Data Engineering

Passionate about leveraging data to drive meaningful insights and actionable solutions. Skilled in data modelling, artificial intelligence, and data engineering. Thrive in fast-paced, analytical environments, delivering impactful results through data-driven strategies. Excited to contribute my expertise to drive innovation and solve complex challenges in the field of data.

I love learning new things especially computer vision, data, or programming related. Doing personal projects has been my favourite way to learn ever since I start learning programming. Most of my personal projects uploaded to Github are data science and computer vision related, but I also have been learning quite a few about data engineering and backend programming lately since this field also caught my interest.

I am now looking to further develop and use my skills in industry placement, especially in data and tech related fields, whether it is a system, a hardware, or anything in between.

- 🌱 I’m currently using and (always) learning Python, SQL, and Big Data Tools.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on understanding more and more data engineering and data related algorithm and learning to become a better programmer and data analyst/scientist
- 🏆 I dream of becoming a major player in technology development
