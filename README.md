I’m a fresh graduate mathematics student from Bandung Institute of Technology. I have a strong interest in tech world, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and programming. I love learning new things especially computer vision, data, or programming related. Doing personal projects has been my favourite way to learn ever since I start learning programming. Most of my personal projects uploaded to Github are data science and computer vision related, but I also have been learning quite a few about backend programming lately since this field also caught my interest.

I am now looking to further develop and use my skills in industry placement, especially in programming, computer vision, or developing any AI based technology, whether it is a system, a hardware, or anything in between.

- 🌱 I’m currently using and (always) learning Python, SQL, and C++.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on understanding more and more computer vision and data related algorithm and learnign to become a better programmer and data analyst/scientist
- 🏆 I dream of becoming a major player in technology development
